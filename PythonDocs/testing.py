# Type comments by using a hash! A hash will work until you press enter.
"""
If you want to write a comment formatted with enters
then use triple-quotes
"""
"""
Integer division returns the floor
7 / 3 = 2 and 7 / -3 = -3
"""
"""
= assigns values, == tests for equality
"""
"""
You can assign multiple variables at once: a = b = c = 9 or a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
"""
"""
Python reads code from left to right, top to bottom. Order counts!
"""
"""
Floating Point is a fancy way of saying: a number with a decimal.
Operations which take at least one float as an argument will return a float.
"""
"""
In interactive mode the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _
"""
"""
round(float, int) will return a float rounded to 'int' number of decimals.
Negative ints move to the left of the decimal, positive to the right. A 0 'int'
will round to the nearest one's place.
Ex. round(2.345, 1) == 2.3, round(2.345, 0) == 2
"""
"""
long() does something but I don't know what
"""
"""
complex number are written float + floatj
Their components can be called by variable_name.real and variable_name.imag
Comps can't be converted to ints and floats
"""
"""
backslash before, neutralizes apostrophes and quotes in a string.
Ex, "\"Hooray!\", he yelled."
"""
"""
\ at the end of a print line applies the print to the next line,
and prints both lines on the same line.
\n in a print line prints the text following it on a new line.
(how do I get rid of the annoying space this produces on the next line?
\n\ lets you press enter
and apply print to your new line but print it on it's own line
\t inserts an 8 space long tab before the next space.
"""
"""
Triple quotes or apostrophes allow you to move around and start new lines
without using \n, although those commands still work.
"""
"""
r"string" nullifies all \, \n, and \t's in the string. The string is 'raw.'
"""
"""
when printing multiple unmoded strings, you can join them with +, they can also
concantenate themselves. However a string and a mod string will not auto-concat.
"""
"""
'string'.strip('chars') will remove any characters in 'chars' from 'string'
and return what remains.
"""
"""
Strings can be repeated with *, ex: print "cat" * 2
"""
"""
You can't reassign characters or substrings in a string
"""
"""
x[:i] + x[i:] == x
"""
"""
string[-1] returns the last character in the string.
"""
"""
A unicode string can be written thus: u'string'
if you have declared a unicode string you can insert raw unicode inside by
typing \u and then entering one 4 digit hexadecimal.
"""
"""
You might want to get a handle on Unicode/ASCII/UTF-8/16
"""
"""
numbers and strings are simple data
lists and dictionaries are compound data
lists can be concatenated just like strings, except you need the +.
lists can be repeated just like strings. This will produce one list.
list[:] and string[:] return the whole thing
lists can be modified in many ways. Individual items or slices can be revalued,
items can be inserted, lists can be wiped clean, etc.
A single list can contain multiple kinds of data, both simple and complex.
"""
"""
the body of a loop can be ended with a blank line
