print followed by blanks does not occupy an actual line.

When printing you can use \ after , to indicate continuation of print input on the next line

Exhaustive Enumeration: An algorithmic technique that orders tests of all possible values.

Decrementing Function: 
!!!All loops can be thought of as decrementing functions!!!
1.) Map set of program variables to an integer
2.) Starts with a non-negative value
3.) When <=0, loop terminates.
4.) Decreased each iteration

In the find cube root function the decrementing function is:
abs(x) - ans**3
In order to break ans**3 < abs(x) we must reach the point where: 
abs(x) - ans**3 <= 0
Each time we increase ans, the value of this difference decreases, comes closer and closer to 0.

The decrementing function is just a rearrangement of the conditional

Another example: 

for x in range(1, y):
	print x

Here the decrementing function is y - x. When y - x <= 0, the loop breaks.


Exhaustive Enumeration: Try all possible answers.
Brute Force: A program that uses exhaustive enumeration.

Range(x,y) generates a tuple (x, x + 1, ..., y - 1)

Approximation is standard practice in computing. 
Find the approximate square root of x, y, such that abs(x - y**2) < E
where E is an epsilon we choose as an acceptable error range.
The above is a Specification of the problem.
Time taken to find answer depends on: abs(start point - sqrt), step-size, epsilon.

Bisection Search: a popular algorithmic technique

1.) Test the midpoint of the search space.
2.) If too big, test the midpoint of the lower half, vice versa.

We do this with three variables. The low, the high, the midpoint. Midpoint equals low plus high over two.
If the midpoint is too low we set low equal to the midpoint and recalculate the midpoint. if the midpoint is too high we set high equal to the midpoint and recalculate the midpoint.

Search space = X * Epsilon(or /Epsilon)

Be careful that the step is not too big for epsilon
